# Test Drive: Anthropic SDK 0.3.241 Upgrade (CYPACK-1462)

**Date**: 2026-08-23
**Goal**: Verify that an F1 Claude session initializes through the upgraded Agent SDK with the refreshed Cyrus tool catalog.
**Test Repo**: Fresh rate-limiter fixture under `/private/tmp`

## Verification Results

### Issue-Tracker

- [x] Issue created
- [x] Issue ID returned
- [x] Issue metadata accessible

### EdgeWorker

- [x] Session started
- [x] Worktree created
- [x] Activities tracked
- [ ] Agent completed the requested repository inspection

### Renderer

- [x] Activity format correct
- [x] Pagination works
- [x] Search works

## Session Log

- `CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 ping` reported the server healthy.
- `CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 status` reported the server ready.
- Created `DEF-1` and selected `F1 Test Repository` through the routing elicitation.
- EdgeWorker created the worktree and passed all 31 configured built-in tools to the Agent SDK, including `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskList`, `LSP`, and `ShareOnboardingGuide`.
- The SDK assigned a Claude session ID and emitted system/model activities.
- The live model turn returned an account-policy error because Claude subscription access is disabled for the test organization. This prevented a completed assistant response but occurred after SDK initialization and tool configuration.
- Pagination (`--limit 2 --offset 2`) and activity search (`--search Routing`) returned the expected activity subsets.
- `stop-session` succeeded and the F1 server shut down cleanly on `SIGINT`.

## Final Retrospective

The upgraded SDK initializes correctly and receives the complete Cyrus tool catalog. Issue creation, repository selection, worktree setup, activity rendering, pagination, search, and shutdown all worked. A full model response remains unverified in this environment because the organization policy blocks Claude subscription access; rerun the same drive in an organization with Claude access to close that final validation gap.
