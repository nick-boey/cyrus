# Test Drive: CYPACK-1474 Release v0.2.69

**Date**: 2026-08-26
**Goal**: Validate the local F1 issue, Claude session, and activity-rendering flow before publishing v0.2.69.
**Test Repo**: `/tmp/f1-release-v0.2.69-6y1Y1T/repo`
**F1 Port**: `3600`

## Verification Results

### Issue-Tracker
- [x] Issue created
- [x] Issue ID returned
- [x] Issue metadata accessible through session view

### EdgeWorker
- [x] Session started
- [x] Worktree created
- [x] Activities tracked
- [x] Claude processed the issue successfully

### Renderer
- [x] Activity format correct
- [x] Pagination works
- [ ] Search works (the F1 CLI has no session-search command)

## Session Log

```bash
apps/f1/f1 init-test-repo --path /tmp/f1-release-v0.2.69-6y1Y1T/repo
CYRUS_PORT=3600 CYRUS_DEFAULT_RUNNER=claude \
  CYRUS_REPO_PATH=/tmp/f1-release-v0.2.69-6y1Y1T/repo \
  bun run apps/f1/server.ts
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 ping
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 status
```

Result: the fresh test repository was initialized, the server started on port 3600, ping returned healthy, and status returned `ready`.

```bash
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 create-issue \
  --title "Release v0.2.69 F1 validation" \
  --description "Validate the Cyrus v0.2.69 release by inspecting the configured repository and reporting its current implementation status. Do not edit files."
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 start-session --issue-id issue-1
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 prompt-session \
  --session-id session-1 \
  --message "Use the configured test repository for this issue."
```

Result: F1 created `issue-1` / `DEF-1` and `session-1`. After repository selection, EdgeWorker created the issue worktree, selected the Claude runner, and reported model `claude/claude-sonnet-5`.

```bash
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 view-session --session-id session-1
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 view-session --session-id session-1 --limit 10 --offset 0
```

Result: the Claude-backed inspection completed successfully. The session rendered 18 coherent activities, including elicitation, prompt, thought, action, and final response activity. Pagination returned the requested 10-row window and displayed continuation guidance.

```bash
CYRUS_PORT=3600 apps/f1/f1 stop-session --session-id session-1
```

Result: the session stop request succeeded and the F1 server shut down gracefully.

## Final Retrospective

F1 validated the full local server, issue tracker, repository-selection recovery, worktree creation, Claude execution, activity rendering, pagination, successful final response, session stop, and graceful server shutdown paths for v0.2.69. The generated test repository intentionally has unfinished algorithms and tests; the agent correctly performed an inspection-only task without modifying it.
